    <para>Thumper is an implementation of the RFC-3161 secure time-stamping service. Both client
      and server programs are provided. The client is used to request time-stamps and the
      server, running as a trusted third party, is used to create time-stamps.</para>

    <para>Security sensitive parts of the system are written in SPARK and proved free of
      run-time errors. Additional security and correctness properties are also proved in some
      cases. Certain aspects of the user interface code, deemed to be non-critical, are written
      in full Ada and take advantage of non-verified libraries such as GtkAda.</para>
