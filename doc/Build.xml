  <title>Building and Testing Thumper</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to build Thumper and its associated documentation. We also
    outline how to test Thumper. The tools with specific version numbers shown below are the
    official tools used by the Thumper contributors. Other tools (or other versions of the same
    tools) may also work. Obviously the greater the differences between the tools you attempt to
    use and those listed below the more trouble you are likely to encounter during the build
    process.</para>

  <para>Two versions of the Thumper server exist. One is written in SPARK 2014 and the other is
    written in Haskell. The Thumper client is not under active development at this time.</para>

  <section>
    <title>SPARK 2014 Build</title>

    <para>In this section the tools needed to build and test the SPARK version of Thumper are
      described. If you are interested in only the Haskell version of Thumper you can skip to
      the following section.</para>

      <title>Build Tools</title>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>GNAT</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>We use the GNAT GPL 2014 Ada compiler from AdaCore. It can be used freely for
            open source projects such as Thumper. Thumper makes use of some GNAT-specific
            libraries that are bundled with GNAT but that might not be available with another
            Ada compiler. These libraries are contained in package <package>GNAT</package> and
            its child packages.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>SPARK</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>We use the SPARK GPL 2014 tools to verify the integrity of the Thumper
            server.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>GPS</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>We use the GPS integrated development environment that comes with GNAT GPL 2014
            as our IDE. GPS is able to integrate both Ada development and SPARK analysis.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>AUnit</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Thumper test program makes use of the AUnit unit testing framework. AUnit is
            maintained by AdaCore and is part of the GNAT GPL 2014 distribution.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Python RFC-3161</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>To exercise the server without a specific client we make use of the Python
            RFC-3161 implementation <ulink url="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rfc3161"
              >here</ulink>. We recommend that this package be downloaded and unpacked into a
            folder such as <filename>rfc3161-x.y.z</filename> off the root of your working copy.
            Various scripts and paths assume this location for a suitable version x.y.z
            (currently 0.1.6 at the time of this writing). The Python RFC-3161 package requires
            the pyasn1 package as a prerequisite. You can install that package using the command
              <command>pypm install pyasn1</command></para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>DocBook</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The documentation is written in DocBook. It is an XML format and so is readable
            in an ordinary text editor. However, if you want to build nicely formatted
            documentation you will need a tool chain for processing DocBook documents. Several
            such tool chains exist. This document does not discuss the options any
            further.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>To build Thumper install the components listed above and check out the latest Thumper
      source code from GitHub by cloning the URL <ulink
        url="https://github.com/pchapin/thumper.git"/>. Once you have a working copy of the
      project load the project file <filename>Ada/thumper.gpr</filename> into GPS. You will find
      the main files <filename>thumper_server.adb</filename> and
        <filename>thumper_client.adb</filename>. Build these files to generate the server and
      client programs respectively. Note that at the time of this writing the client program is
      only a skeleton.</para>

    <para>To test Thumper, build the main file thumper_test.adb. Executing the resulting program
      will run all the unit tests and produce a report of the results on the console.</para>
