  <title>Building Thumper</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to build Thumper and its associated documentation. The tools
    with specific version numbers shown below are the official tools used by the Thumper
    contributors. Other tools (or other versions of the same tools) may also work. Obviously the
    greater the differences between the tools you attempt to use and those listed below the more
    trouble you are likely to encounter during the build process.</para>

  <para>Two versions of the Thumper server exist. One is written in SPARK and the other is
    written in Haskell. The Thumper client is not under active development at this time.</para>

  <section>
    <title>SPARK Build</title>

    <para>In this section the tools needed to build and test the SPARK version of Thumper are
      described. If you are interested in only the Haskell version of Thumper you can skip to
      the following section.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <title>Build Tools</title>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>GNAT</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>We use the GNAT GPL 2012 Ada compiler from AdaCore. It can be used freely for
            open source projects such as Thumper. Thumper makes use of some GNAT-specific
            libraries that are bundled with GNAT but that might not be available with another
            Ada compiler. These libraries are contained in package <package>GNAT</package> and
            its child packages.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>SPARK</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>We use the SPARK GPL 2012 tools to verify the integrity of the Thumper
            server.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>GPS</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>We use the GPS integrated development environment that comes with GNAT GPL 2012
            as our IDE. GPS is able to integrate both Ada development and SPARK analysis.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>AUnit</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Thumper test program makes use of the AUnit unit testing framework. AUnit is
            maintained by AdaCore and can be downloaded from the same site as GNAT GPL.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>DocBook</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The documentation is written in DocBook. It is an XML format and so is readable
            in an ordinary text editor. However, if you want to build nicely formatted
            documentation you will need a tool chain for processing DocBook documents. Several
            such tool chains exist. This document does not discuss the options any
            further.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>To build Thumper install the components listed above and check out the latest Thumper
      source code from GitHub by cloning the URL <ulink
        url="https://github.com/pchapin/thumper.git"/>. Once you have a working copy of the
      project load the project file <filename>Ada/thumper.gpr</filename> into GPS. You will find
      the main files <filename>thumper_server.adb</filename> and
        <filename>thumper_client.adb</filename>. Build these files to generate the server and
      client programs respectively. Note that at the time of this writing the client program is
      only a skeleton.</para>

    <para>To test Thumper, build the main file thumper_test.adb. Executing the resulting program
      will run all the unit tests and produce a report of the results on the console.</para>
