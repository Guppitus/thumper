Thumper
=======

Thumper is a secure time stamp client/server system that implements RFC-3161. It allows clients
to obtain cryptographic time stamps that can be used to later verify that certain documents
existed on or before the time mentioned in the time stamp. Thumper is written in multiple
programming languages, and used as a vehicle for exploring high integrity programming
techniques. Currently versions in SPARK/Ada and Scala are provided. The system is most mature in
SPARK/Ada.

The system is intended to satisfy two major goals.

1. To serve as an educational vehicle for secure, high integrity programming, along with related
   topics.

2. To allow students to obtain strong time stamps of their work that can be used to prove it was
   completed on time.

See the documentation in the doc folder for more information.
